# Assignment 5

## Setup instructions

- Install Docker (version >=24.0.5) and Docker Desktop (version >=4.22.1).

- Download the `.env` file that we've submitted to Canvas CS3219's "Sharing Assignment Private Info" assignment, and place it in the root of the repo.

- Start the app via the `start_containers.sh` script:
  ```bash
  bash start_containers.sh
  ```

  (if it fails to start, try doing `docker-compose down` to remove old containers)

### Accessing the web app
After starting containers, the web app will be accessible at: `http://localhost`.
