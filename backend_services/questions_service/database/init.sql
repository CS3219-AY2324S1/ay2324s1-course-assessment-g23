'### Roman Numerals
 Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: I, V, X, L, C, D, and M.

 ### Symbols and Values
 | Symbol | Value |
 | ------ | ----- |
 | I      | 1     |
 | V      | 5     |
 | X      | 10    |
 | L      | 50    |
 | C      | 100   |
 | D      | 500   |
 | M      | 1000  |

 ### Examples
 - For example, 2 is written as `II` in Roman numeral, just two ones added together.
 - 12 is written as `XII`, which is simply `X + II`.
 - The number 27 is written as `XXVII`, which is `XX + V + II`.

 Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, there are exceptions such as the numeral for four, which is not `IIII`. Instead, the number four is written as `IV`. This is because the one is before the five, and so we subtract it, making four. This same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as `IX`.

 ### Subtraction Instances
 There are six instances where subtraction is used:
 - `I` can be placed before `V` (5) and `X` (10) to make 4 and 9.
 - `X` can be placed before `L` (50) and `C` (100) to make 40 and 90.
 - `C` can be placed before `D` (500) and `M` (1000) to make 400 and 900.

 ### Conversion Examples

 ### Example 1:
 - Input: `s = "III"`
 - Output: `3`
 - Explanation: `III` = 3.

 ### Example 2:
 - Input: `s = "LVIII"`
 - Output: `58`
 - Explanation: `L = 50`, `V= 5`, `III = 3`.

 ### Example 3:
 - Input: `s = "MCMXCIV"`
 - Output: `1994`
 - Explanation: `M = 1000`, `CM = 900`, `XC = 90` and `IV = 4`.

 ### Constraints
 - `1 <= s.length <= 15`
 - `s` contains only the characters ("I", "V", "X", "L", "C", "D", "M").
 - It is guaranteed that `s` is a valid roman numeral in the range `[1, 3999]`.

+-------------+----------+ 
id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table. 
The table holds all taxi trips. Each trip has a unique id, while client_id and 
driver_id are foreign keys to the users_id at the Users table. 
Status is an ENUM (category) type of (''completed'', ''cancelled_by_driver'', 
''cancelled_by_client''). 
 
Table: Users 
+-------------+----------+ 
| Column Name | Type     | 
+-------------+----------+

| banned      | enum     | 
| role        | enum     | 
+-------------+----------+ 
users_id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table. 
The table holds all users. Each user has a unique users_id, and role is an 
ENUM type of (''client'', ''driver'', ''partner''). 
banned is an ENUM (category) type of (''Yes'', ''No''). 
 
The cancellation rate is computed by dividing the number of canceled (by 
client or driver) requests with unbanned users by the total number of 
requests with unbanned users on that day. 
Write a solution to find the cancellation rate of requests with unbanned 
users (both client and driver must not be banned) each day between "2013-
10-01" and "2013-10-03". Round Cancellation Rate to two decimal points. 
Return the result table in any order. 
The result format is in the following example.

Explanation: 
On 2013-10-01: 
 - There were 4 requests in total, 2 of which were canceled. 
 - However, the request with Id=2 was made by a banned client (User_Id=2), 
so it is ignored in the calculation. 
 - Hence there are 3 unbanned requests in total, 1 of which was canceled. 
 - The Cancellation Rate is (1 / 3) = 0.33 
On 2013-10-02: 
 - There were 3 requests in total, 0 of which were canceled. 
 - The request with Id=6 was made by a banned client, so it is ignored. 
 - Hence there are 2 unbanned requests in total, 0 of which were canceled. 
 - The Cancellation Rate is (0 / 2) = 0.00 
On 2013-10-03: 
 - There were 3 requests in total, 1 of which was canceled. 
 - The request with Id=8 was made by a banned client, so it is ignored. 
 - Hence there are 2 unbanned request in total, 1 of which were canceled. 
 - The Cancellation Rate is (1 / 2) = 0.50
